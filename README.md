# Faster Path

A mod for Necesse that makes walking on path tiles a lot faster!

Speed can be modified by running the game once after you've downloaded the mod.
A folder should appear in the game's local folder,
which you can find by right-clicking Necesse in your Steam library &rarr; Manage &rarr; Browse local files.
In `settings/fasterPath/settings.cfg`, modify the `speedModifier=1.0` to whatever value you like!

The value adds to the original value in the vanilla game, which is `0.1`.
So a `speedModifier` of `1` means now path gives a speed boost of `1.1`.
I suggest to have the value between `1.0 to 2.0` for a better experience.
But who says you can't have fun by changing it to 10!

## Important Notes:

- Game have to be restarted for the changes to be made
